This file describes the modifications to Array Oligo Selector (AOS) 
that are made to allow a shared library of AOS routines to be use in 
side other processes.

Useful functions in the library:
    int SW (char *seq1, char *seq2, int alignment, int size,char* buff);
    double energy(char *s1, char *s2, int revert);
    int LZWsize(char* seq, int size)

The AOS C code has been hacked here to move or remove 'main' functions
and a Makefile is provided that should aid in building the shared
library. It is known to work with gcc 4.2.1 on FreeBSD-7.0, amd64.
Note that this implies a generic UNIX make and is not tested with
gmake.  However I suspect that the code and build requirements are
basic enough that it should work or may be made to work on most
POSIXish systems.  


An example python interface module is provided: aos.py.  It expects
the compiled shared library to be in the same directory as the
module. 

The AOS Pick70 python code and various LINUX binaries have been
removed. As always the original AOS is avalible at
arrayoligosel.sourceforge.net. AOS and deriviative works (including
this one) are released subject to the restrictions of GPLv2
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.o.html).
